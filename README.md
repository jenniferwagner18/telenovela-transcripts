# Analyze Spanish-Language Telenovela Transcripts

This Python code can be used to create .txt files out of .htm pages (batch downloaded with [DownThemAll](https://www.downthemall.net/)) and extract out the text contained in the `<p>` tags, so it is best suited for transcripts of episodes of Univision telenovelas. The .txt files can be then analyzed in [AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) for most frequent words or phrases using the Clusters/N-Grams option.
