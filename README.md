This Python code can be used to create .txt files out of .htm pages (batch downloaded with DownThemAll) and extract out the text contained in the `<p>` tags, so it is best suited for transcripts of episodes of Univision telenovelas. The .txt files can be then analyzed in AntConc for most frequent words or phrases using the Clusters/N-Grams option.
